I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in December, 2019 with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Japanese. While I have lived in Colorado all of my life, being rooted here has not stopped me from traveling. This includes my study abroad semester, in which I visited each of the main Japanese islands as well as Okinawa.
			I put high value in learning, from taking summer classes every year for six years to taking courses via Udemy after I graduated to gain more skills. In fact, the creation of this very website stemmed from wanting to learn something new. </p>

			<h2>What I Know</h2>
			<p> From my education and beyond, there are a lot of skills that I hope can be useful in the industry. In addition to the baseline data structures and algorithm classes, I took courses on the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data Science</li>
				<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
				<li>Database Systems</li>
				<li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
				<li>Software Development</li>
				<li>Computer Graphics/Animation</li>
				<li>Japanese Language Classes, including Classical Japanese</li>
				<li>And More</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p> With these classes and more, I was able to build the following skills: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Python Libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Spacy, Keras, and Scikit Learn</li>
				<li>Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and other data cleaning and exploration tools</li>
				<li>MySQL and SQL Server</li>
				<li>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)</li>
				<li>C/C++</li>
				<li>Tableau</li>
				<li>HTML/Bootstrap/Django (Learned from building this site)</li>
				<li>And More</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p> I hope to keep building more skills moving forward. This is currently manifesting in practice with datasets on Kaggle, but I hope to learn more about how I learn and potentially go back to school to better leverage that environment.</p>
